// Authors: Misho Gabashvili and Reese Neal
// NetID: mg2736, rjn29
//
// Time for this program: ~45 hours 
//
// To run the Cupid Battle game, please compile the CupidBattle.java file
// either manually or using the play button. Our program does not take 
// in any user input in the terminal. Instead, please refer to the 
// buttons in the panel to choose your game mode and simulate the 
// arrow motion each round. 
// We encourage you to play the game in the fullscreen mode. However the 
// width and the height of the panel can be adjusted (in both CupidBattle
// and Arrow files). We recommend that you select the width to be larger
// than 850, with height larger than 700 as well for optimal difficulty.
