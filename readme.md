## Gameplay Features
- **Animation:** Dynamic animations illustrate the arrow's trajectory during flight.
- **Simulated Physics:** Realistic physics, including gravity and wind speed, impact arrow motion.

## How to Run
- Compile all .java files using javac *.java and then run program by using java CupidsBattle.java
- The program does not take any user input in the terminal. Refer to the buttons in the panel to choose your game mode and simulate arrow motion each round.
- We recommend playing the game in fullscreen mode. Adjust the width and height of the panel (in both `CupidBattle` and `Arrow` files) for optimal difficulty.
- We recommend selecting a width larger than 850 and a height larger than 700 for optimal difficulty.
